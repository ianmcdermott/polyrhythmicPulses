# Polyrhythmic Pulses
## Museum: Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden
## Activitiy: Maker Mornings

## Project:
Public engagement workshop to explain some of the technology and concepts behind the Pulse exhibit. 

Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's inspiration for Pulse Room came from an experience he had when his wife was pregnant with twins. Instead of one sonogram machine, he requested two, allowing him to hear the separate beats of his children simultaneously. This created a sonic effect known as a polyrhythm, a technique used commonly in non-western music, as well as contemporary electronic music and minimalist composers like Phillip Glass, Steve Reich and Terry Riley. Each of Raphaels pieces in the pulse exhibit play with this idea of polyrhythm in various ways, but viewers are often unaware of this concept, so it can be lost. 


The purpose of this maker hour was give Hirshhorn visitors deeper insight so that they could see another layer of the Pulse exhibit. Using some of the same sensors from the exhibit, a custom application I built with Processing software, and Ableton, museum visitors were able to create their own polyrhythms using their pulses, explained in the descriptions below. 

## EXERCISE 1 - POLYRHYTHMS - The Code in this Repo
###
Each visitor's heartbeat was detected by the pulse sensor and loaded into a MIDI scroll of its own Ableton instrument. Every new heartbeat had a different tone, following a predetermined scale. Once multiple heartbeats were added, a polyrhythmic pattern formed with a mood based on the chosen scale.</br>

# EXERCISE 2 - EUCLIDEAN RHYTHMS - Code in https://github.com/ianmcdermott/euclidean-pulses
Every participant takes their pulse with a pulse sensor. Their BPM is processed through a euclidean algorithm, which calculates the optimal spacing between each beat within a timeframe. Every beat is then added to a box within a row in a midi timeline. Each row represents a different drum, with the green squares playing a sound clip of the drum when the vertical white bar passes over.
